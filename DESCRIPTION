Description: Provides nonparametric CUSUM tests for detecting changes
  in possibly serially dependent univariate or multivariate
  observations. Tests sensitive to changes in the expectation, the
  variance, the covariance, the autocovariance, the distribution
  function, Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, Gini's mean difference, and
  the copula are provided, as well as a test for detecting changes in
  the distribution of independent block maxima (with environmental
  studies in mind). The latest additions are a test sensitive to
  changes in the autocopula and a combined test of stationarity
  sensitive to changes in the distribution function and the
  autocopula.
