Title: Some nonparametric tests for change-point detection in
        (multivariate) observations

Suggests: copula
Description: Provides nonparametric tests for assessing whether possibly serially dependent (multivariate) continuous observations have the same c.d.f. or not. In addition to tests focusing directly on the (multivariate) c.d.f., the package contains tests designed to be particularly sensitive to changes in the underlying copula.
